# wants to use the seeded-psuedorandomness feature, so it can issue queries like this across many peers.
#
# Perhaps we won't actually need the 'patch' feature, because in practice if doing queries with lots
# of fancy sharded requests, prooobably you'll do the path *up to* that first, in a separate query,

in which attributes we're storing, we can make unixfsv2 into an extensible yet still
very well defined system.</p> <p>Concretely: If the <code>uid</code> and <code>gid</code> elements are found present in the first <code>Attribs</code> map
processed in a tree of data, then we match the first schema (the one with more info),
and we can now expect <em>all future</em> <code>Attribs</code> maps to consistently include the same data.
If the <code>uid</code> or <code>gid</code> elements are found to be missing, we would flunk out of matching
the first schema, and try a second schema which does not include them... and again,
now expect <em>all future</em> <code>Attribs</code> maps to consistently <em>not</em> include these data.</p> <p>This kind of deep consistency makes it easier to build applications,
especially applications which may want to change their behavior
or apply distinct transformations depending on which of the schemas matches.</p> <h3 id="advanced-layout-usage-sites-are-marked-with-angle-brackets"><a href="#advanced-layout-usage-sites-are-marked-with-angle-brackets" class="header-anchor">#</a> Advanced layout usage sites are marked with angle brackets</h3> <p>E.g., on the line <code>members {Filename:DirEnt}&lt;HAMT&gt;</code>, it's the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>
characters which denote that we'll be using an advanced layout here.</p> <p>We might also consider using different characters for this denotation.
(Angle brackets are reminiscent of generics in Java syntax;
this may or may not be a helpful reminiscence.)</p> <p>We might also consider a different approach entirely: ditching the ability to
declare advanced layouts on inline type terms at all, and instead using
something more like the <code>representation</code> keyword.
Such an approach would syntactically require a fully named type for any
structure that wants to use an advanced layout.
Given that the most common applications of advanced layouts are for map, list,
and byte kinds, all of which tend to be used via anonymous inline types,
this could result in a substantial increase in syntax volume
(e.g., in this example, it would've lead to two new named types).</p> <p>(Note that the previous paragraph has only considered schema <em>DSL syntax</em>;
perhaps the issue looks differently if considered via the IPLD-native &quot;AST&quot;.)</p> <h3 id="advanced-layout-usage-sites-are-marked"><a href="#advanced-layout-usage-sites-are-marked" class="header-anchor">#</a> Advanced layout usage sites are marked</h3> <p>See https://github.com/ipld/specs/issues/130 -- specifically,
the &quot;signaling&quot; problem -- for more discussion of this.</p> <p>We're exploring the &quot;explicit signaling&quot; approach, and doing so
using schemas as the vehicle, here.</p> <h3 id="advanced-layouts-promising-a-kind"><a href="#advanced-layouts-promising-a-kind" class="header-anchor">#</a> Advanced layouts promising a kind?</h3> <p>The <code>kind map</code> and <code>kind bytes</code> markings in the <code>advanced</code> blocks are a hypothesis.</p> <p>In the cases shown in this example, we definitely know that these are the kinds
we expect the advanced layout algorithms in question to behave as.
This may not always be true (e.g. in the encryption user story, not explored here).</p> <p>The kind is also indicated at the usage site -- e.g. the <code>{</code> character
at the start of the usage site <code>members {Filename:DirEnt}&lt;HAMT&gt;</code> already
makes it quite clear that we're dealing with a map kind -- so perhaps
kind indicators in the <code>advanced</code> block is redundant.  Or, perhaps by the
other side of the same coin, they're a good sanity-check landmark.</p> <h3 id="advanced-layout-implementation-strings"><a href="#advanced-layout-implementation-strings" class="header-anchor">#</a> Advanced layout implementation strings</h3> <p>See https://github.com/ipld/specs/issues/130 -- specifically,
the &quot;referencing&quot; (or &quot;rendezvous&quot;) problem -- for more discussion of this.</p> <p>We're exploring with the &quot;behavioral specification&quot; approach here.</p> <h3 id="what-are-executables-anyway"><a href="#what-are-executables-anyway" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are executables, anyway?</h3> <p>In this schema, the executablity bit is in the <code>Attribs.posix</code> bitfield...
as three distinct bools, once per user/group/everyone (the <code>0111</code> mask).</p> <p>Another way to regard executablity which would often (often!) be valid is
to have a single bool per file.</p> <p>These are two different opinions application design might take in regarding
unix<em>ish</em> filesystems.  Logically consistent arguments can be made for both.
Perhaps this is another situation where two different schemas would be useful;
we can support both, and do so clearly, if we think it's useful to do so.</p> <h3 id="ugh-int-sizes"><a href="#ugh-int-sizes" class="header-anchor">#</a> Ugh, int sizes</h3> <blockquote><p>mtime Int</p></blockquote> <p>In designing the IPLD Data Model itself, we still have some deferred decisions
about how we want to regard integer precision (as well as what we expect,
in practice, when client implementations in various languages hit their
host language's natural limitations).</p> <p>We should probably give particular attention to timestamps in such decisions.
They're a very common user story.</p> <p>Additionally, regardless of what precisely we decide to do about integer sizes,
we should aim to have documentation with recommendations of best practices
for the timestamp user story.</p> <h3 id="links"><a href="#links" class="header-anchor">#</a> Links</h3> <p>The <code>&amp;</code> syntax seen in <code>content &amp;AnyFile</code> denotes that the <code>AnyFile</code> is
expected on the far side of a Link in that position.</p> <p>Denotation of the position of a link is important because It Matters To The Hash,
as well as mattering to the overall understanding of topology of the larger DAG;
yet it's terse because it doesn't matter to the semantics of the design (much).</p> <p>The single character sigil would seem to imply that there's no such thing as an <code>&amp;&amp;Foo</code> or <code>&amp;&amp;&amp;Foo</code>.
Which indeed I hope there isn't: this author can't think of any situations
where that expresses a sane thing.  (It's rare enough in programming with pointers;
it's an entirely separate thing to propose in a merkle-DAG, which has no mutablity
semantics in the first place, which removes even the 'rare' excuses.)
We haven't officially explored or documented this anywhere yet.  Probably we should.</p> <h3 id="did-you-notice-we-still-don-t-have-enough-information-to-determine-cids"><a href="#did-you-notice-we-still-don-t-have-enough-information-to-determine-cids" class="header-anchor">#</a> Did you notice we still don't have enough information to determine CIDs?</h3> <p>This schema does not specify which:</p> <ul><li>CID version;</li> <li>multicodec;</li> <li>nor multihash</li></ul> <p>... to use when serializing any block data and constructing links.</p> <p>It also doesn't specify any restrictions for those values when reading data.</p> <p>That's... interesting.  What does this imply for work that's still left to do
in systems which build using these tools?</p> <h3 id="do-advanced-layouts-deserve-parameters"><a href="#do-advanced-layouts-deserve-parameters" class="header-anchor">#</a> Do advanced layouts deserve parameters?</h3> <p>We could imagine having blocks with details such as this in the schema:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>advanced Rabin {
	kind bytes
	implementation &quot;IPLD/experimental/rabin/v1&quot;
	bitmatch 14
	minchunksize 256
	maxchunksize 262144
}

advanced HAMT {
	kind map
	implementation &quot;IPLD/experimental/HAMT/v1&quot;
	bitwidth 14
}
</code></pre></div><p>Would this be better?</p> <p>See the &quot;Other&quot; heading in https://github.com/ipld/specs/issues/130
for another introduction of this question.</p> <p>A separate, but co-located, question is whether such parameters
(if we have them) should be serialized in the internal data of the advanced
layout (e.g. typically in the 'root block' of that structure), or if
they should be here in the schema.
This author tends to think the answer may be &quot;both&quot;; it certainly seems
they must be in the schema if schemas are to fulfill their purpose
as a design language and provide sufficient information for it to be
possible to make diverse implementations in new languages.</p> <p>The full schema at the top of the document explores the choices
of &quot;no&quot;, and is thus ambiguous on that second question.</p> <h2 id="some-errata"><a href="#some-errata" class="header-anchor">#</a> Some Errata</h2> <h3 id="some-unixfs-naming-notes"><a href="#some-unixfs-naming-notes" class="header-anchor">#</a> Some unixfs naming notes</h3> <p><code>AnyFile</code> may be a clunky name.  Suggestions welcome.</p> <p>One possible alternative that we've already chosen to avoid here is &quot;inode&quot;,
because that term has a lot of associations with mutable filesystems (and
currently MFS does already have such a concept).</p> <h3 id="things-not-included-for-brevity"><a href="#things-not-included-for-brevity" class="header-anchor">#</a> Things not included for brevity</h3> <p>It's likely the real Unixfsv2 will include more members of <code>AnyFile</code>,
such as unix socket files, device node properties, etc.
These are omitted here for brevity; omission here is not meant to suggest that
such things don't belong in later more complete documents which are
on a path to becoming specs.</p> <h3 id="remember-selectors-are-coming"><a href="#remember-selectors-are-coming" class="header-anchor">#</a> Remember, Selectors Are Coming</h3> <p>It should be noted that there have been previous discussions about whether or not,
and to what degree, it is important to be able to &quot;inline&quot; small objects.</p> <p>To the best of this author's understanding, much (all?) of the reason to
wish for the ability to &quot;inline&quot; small objects is loading a link is cheap
only when the content is local, and may become significantly high latency
if the content requires retrieval over a network (especially if that retrieval
requires a search for a peer who has the content!).</p> <p>Selectors are a feature which make it possible to describe fetching whole
graphs of linked data at once, rather than in an &quot;N+1 query&quot; fashion,
and so they dramatically change the field of play here: possibly reducing
the performance penalties of &quot;unnecessary&quot; blocks/links to infinitesimal.</p> <p>We're expecting this feature to land &quot;soon&quot; (on the same timescale, and
almost certainly before, any final unixfsv2 specs themselves), so it seems
valid to design link placements with that improvement in mind.</p> <h3 id="inb4-timezones"><a href="#inb4-timezones" class="header-anchor">#</a> inb4 timezones</h3> <blockquote><p>mtime Int</p></blockquote> <p>Yes, the posix syscalls use raw integers for modification times on files.</p> <p>No, it does not include timezones.</p> <p>Yes, really.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><div class="edit-link"><a href="https://github.com/ipld/specs/edit/master/design/history/exploration-reports/2019.06-unixfsv2-spike-01.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edit this page on GitHub</a> <span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></div> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated:</span> <span class="time">7/13/2021, 12:42:42 AM</span></div></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
