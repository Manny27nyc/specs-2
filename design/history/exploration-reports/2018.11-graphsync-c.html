I thought &quot;we&quot; had already reached consensus that we did need them. They're quite literally the entire point of GraphSync.</p></blockquote> <p>Who is the &quot;we&quot; that <em>already</em> reached a consensus? These concerns have been bubbling for months, we set aside time to unblock them at Lab Week, we wrote up the session proposals ahead of time so people knew they would be happening. There were two sessions, one about replication generally and one about GraphSync specifically. I don't recall who was in each session because it differed between them, but @vmx and I were in both and @diasdavid was either in one of them or we had some sync up after. <strong>[Added Note: I just remembered that it was @diasdavid who first recommended we more formally write up the different conditions for replication]</strong> This PR is the followup from those sessions.</p> <p>Anyway, I don't think we're going to make progress continuing this way. A few things need to be clear:</p> <ol><li>There is no one-size-fits-all replication strategy.</li> <li>We should not continue to pursue solutions without a coherent model of the problem. A single statement about a use case is a not a coherent model, all of these use cases have multiple dimensions to them and when you explore that model you'll see that caching is a part of that model and is unsupported by these solutions to replication.</li> <li>We should probably stop using the term &quot;GraphSync.&quot; There are 3 wildly different proposals and the term now carries so much history with it that we can't unwind the requirements or steer it in a different direction no matter how much we try.</li></ol> <p>I'll be creating a &quot;replication&quot; repo today. That repo will serve as a place to discuss the problem space and model out different conditions and test approaches. Based on our sessions at Lab Week I think that this proposal, whatever we end up calling it, solves the largest performance bottlenecks.</p> <p>The common thread in all of the proposals is that we need a more RPC style interface for replication over libp2p. In the short term we should try to make progress on the necessary changes to enable these interfaces in a modular way so that we can continue to layer on additional APIs for replicators in the future.</p> <p>Also, I think we should break IPLD Selectors into its own spec/PR. Even if you don't send them over the network this selector syntax is an incredible tool at the user API level.</p> <p>Now, just so that they don't get lost in the transition to the replication repo, a few more replies:</p> <blockquote><p>Usually, sending a few extra blocks won't be a problem. As long as the receiver can tell the sender to stop sending some sub-dag, we should be fine.</p></blockquote> <p>I don't think the gains from asking for an indefinite number of blocks will be larger than the lost performance of sending unnecessary blocks until a roundtrip tells the other end to stop sending. You're saving a traversal roundtrip at the expense of many potential cancellation roundtrips, so the gains only play out if 1) there is no cache or 2) changed parts of the graph are greater than the unchanged parts of the graph.</p> <p>For the vast majority of use cases mutations are relatively small and as the size of the graph grows the changes tend to become a smaller portion of that graph. In this model if a single chunk of a large file changed I'd still end up waiting for all the chunks to return since all the chunks of the file are referenced in a single parent. The same goes for large directories that aren't big enough to be sharded (less than a couple thousand files). If a single file changes I'm sitting there consuming and then stopping the subgraph for every file but the one that changed.</p> <p>This is why I was so adamant that the only use case this is preferred for is one where the client contains no cache and is only connected to a single peer. For what it's worth, we spent the first session at Lab Week defining a bunch of replication conditions and following all of these problems with this particular strategy.</p> <blockquote><p>You can also improve this with better traversal orders. For example, a sender can send node A's siblings before sending node A's children, giving the receiver time to receive, parse, and potentially cancel some of node A's children before they're sent.</p></blockquote> <p>What are the network and peer conditions we're trying to optimize for here?</p> <p>The trouble I have with seeing the gains here is that the client roundtrips for requesting subtrees are no longer a factor in total performance once you've saturated the downstream connection.</p> <p>In the case that we are requesting blocks in parallel from a single peer we <em>should</em> saturate the connection relatively quickly unless it's an incredibly deep tree with almost no width at each level. Each level of depth in the tree we gain a mode or parallelism, so it would have to be of a very particular shape. If we're doing the requesting we also have the option of spreading out these requests to other peers and the gains at each layer of depth extend beyond the upstream capabilities of a single peer.</p> <p>In the case we're asking for an indefinite number of blocks, we have this single peer, which we're requesting <em>everything</em> from because you can't parallelize this request, and the graph is shaped in such a way that there's little to no width. That's very particular and I'd like to know more about these particular graphs if we are to design a replication scheme optimized for them. It seems like in a graph of this shape we would also have a good idea of the few CIDs in cache that it can safely stop traversal at that we should also include in this replication scheme.</p> <hr> <h4 id="_2018-11-10t00-44-02z-mikeal"><a href="#_2018-11-10t00-44-02z-mikeal" class="header-anchor">#</a> (2018-11-10T00:44:02Z) mikeal:</h4> <blockquote><p>Load a web-page in a single round-trip.

I'll try to lay out a framework in the replication repo that can give a more productive process to continue under.</p> <hr> <h4 id="_2018-11-12t13-23-48z-vmx"><a href="#_2018-11-12t13-23-48z-vmx" class="header-anchor">#</a> (2018-11-12T13:23:48Z) vmx:</h4> <blockquote><p>There were two sessions, one about replication generally and one about GraphSync specifically.</p></blockquote> <p>@hannahhoward was also attending the discussion about GraphSync</p> <p>I think a I need to clarify why my view is different from what we discussed in Berlin. In Berlin I think I finally got a good understanding of what people mean when they talk about GraphSync. I really liked the idea sending powerful selectors over the network. Though during the GraphSync Deep-Dive in Berlin, I realised (thanks to @b5, @mib-kd743naq) that for merkle verification purpose, you need to a lot of more nodes than the actual selector suggests (think of e.g. &quot;give me all leaf nodes for a file cat&quot;). So the selectors a user requests with will be different from what is sent over the network to another peer.

It wasn't mentioned to me neither in Berlin, nor in Glasgow.</p> <p>Anyway, I think the overlap is quite large. One major difference is just what &quot;IPLD Selectors&quot; mean to everyone. For me they are that user facing things to do complex graph traversals and not some internal implementation detail to make those traversals work.</p> <p>PS: I forgot to /cc @pgte and @aschmahmann.</p> <hr> <h4 id="_2018-11-12t21-23-10z-stebalien"><a href="#_2018-11-12t21-23-10z-stebalien" class="header-anchor">#</a> (2018-11-12T21:23:10Z) Stebalien:</h4> <p>At the end of the day, I think the misunderstanding is what graphsync is trying to solve. We <em>do</em> want selectors for user queries however, we can just use those with bitswap. We needed a new <em>network protocol</em> because bitswap has a severe limitation: we can't ask for anything we can't name <em>directly by cid</em>. This puts some pretty harsh theoretical limits on bitswap's performance in <em>some</em> use-cases (blockchains, git, pathing, streaming balanced dags, etc.).</p> <p>So yeah, I think a decent place to start is to just implement selectors. The idea behind GraphSync B is that we can then just send these selectors over the network iff the other party supports them. Otherwise, we'd &quot;lower&quot; them to the most powerful, selector the other peer <em>does</em> support and then run an interactive protocol. GraphSync C is equivalent (mostly) to a GraphSync B that only supports the CID and IPLD path selector.</p> <hr> <h4 id="_2018-11-15t16-08-59z-daviddias"><a href="#_2018-11-15t16-08-59z-daviddias" class="header-anchor">#</a> (2018-11-15T16:08:59Z) daviddias:</h4> <p>So, is GraphSync C just a MVP of GraphSync B?

With B being a superset of C, I would propose using the protocol described in B to implement the features described here. One thing I would like to make sure is that we don't have to break the protocol completely every time we add a new feature, new selector implementations shouldnt require a whole new protocol, it should just be an opcode within the exisitng protocol that causes another side that doesnt understand it to return an error.
