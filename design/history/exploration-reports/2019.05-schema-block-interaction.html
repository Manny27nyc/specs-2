Maybe the schema is in there or there’s a CID pointing to a schema. The latter is nice because you can use it to associate with known types.</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>{
&quot;_schema&quot;: { &quot;ref&quot;: CID, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;FancyCollectionRootBlock&quot; }
...
}
</code></pre></div><p>Where:</p> <ul><li><code>CID</code> -&gt; the schema text itself</li> <li><code>FancyCollectionRootBlock</code> -&gt; the <code>Type</code> in the schema that this block will map to</li></ul> <p>or embed the schema text in the block itself with:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>&quot;_schema&quot;: {
&quot;def&quot;: &quot;... schema text ...&quot;,
&quot;type&quot;: &quot;NicelyShapedObjectFromUglyBlockLayout&quot;
}
</code></pre></div><p>A loader encounters that and can load the schema from <code>CID</code> or just read it from the inline definition and create an appropriately instantiated form of the block according to the schema.</p> <p>So <code>myNicelyShapedObject = Loader.Load(someCID)</code> would: read the block, find a <code>_schema</code> and know how to turn the raw block layout into <code>NicelyShapedObjectFromUglyBlockLayout</code> form. Maybe it’s a struct from a tuple representation or one of the ugly string concatenation representations but now it’s a beautiful native object/butterfly.</p> <p>Or, for the case of objects which have associated logic, like a multi-block collection that is useless to the user in its decoded+instantiated form. We have a way of “registering” logic with the loader. Maybe the loaders we ship (whatever that is, js-ipld-stack, go-ipld-prime, or some layer above), have some of our standard types already registered. A certain CID might point to a schema of our standard HAMT, so we register the logic for that HAMT into the loader so when it encounters that CID it knows it can not only deode+instantiate a nicely shaped block but it can hand it off to that logic for  further processing or pass that logic back to the user for their own handling.</p> <p>So <code>multiblockMap = Loader.Init(someCID)</code> would: read the block, find a <code>_schema</code>, see that it has a CID that’s been pre-registered with some bit of code—let’s call it “advanced layout logic”. Decode and instantiate the block in its schema-defined form, pass it off to the “advanced layout logic” and give <em>that</em> back to the user. Maybe they get an object that they can do <code>multiblockMap.Get(Key)</code> on and it’ll do some cascading interaction between the loader and the “advanced layout logic” to traverse the tree in an appropriate manner, decoding+instantiating child nodes and figuring out how to traverse further down to <code>Get</code> what the user wants.</p> <p>Maybe the “advanced layout logic” has to have some additional functionality associated with it to allow for interaction with selectors/paths? So you can traverse right into the block-spanning-data-structure with a selector, relying on the “advanced layout logic” that the loader knows about.</p> <p>This CID-registration thing would allow for the loading of custom things that span one or more blocks, a user might make their own <code>FancyCollection</code> that we don’t need to care about, they register the CID for its shema with the loader, <code>Init()</code> a root block and get back their collection. It would also allow versioning of the data types. Maybe we build a HAMT this year with a single <code>elementMap</code> and decide next year that we really should have gone with separate CHAMP <code>dataMap</code> and <code>nodeMap</code> elements, so the root and child node blocks will be different and the logic to traverse will be different. So we just register those two different schema CIDs with two different sets of logic and users will get back a <code>Map</code> with the same API but it loads and traverses blocks differently under the hood.</p> <p>I know I at least have holes in this thinking relating to how IPLD is currently used today, I’m focused on the “get me a collection that I can interact with programatically” case but maybe there’s a lot more (selector traversal?) and maybe that’s not even the right case to be thinking about.</p> <hr> <h4 id="_2019-05-02t03-33-01z-mikeal"><a href="#_2019-05-02t03-33-01z-mikeal" class="header-anchor">#</a> (2019-05-02T03:33:01Z) mikeal:</h4> <p>I don’t see why we would not want to contain all the schema information in the schema instead of as metadata in the reference to the schema, so definitely:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>{ _schema: CID() }
</code></pre></div><p>I’d also like to avoid describing the block boundaries and instead just state that the <code>_schema</code> property <strong>is</strong> the schema, and it may be a link or it could even be inline. In general, we should just avoid these distinctions and make sure our tools for reading things never assume a particular block structure and only a specific graph shape.</p> <p>I don’t see why we would embed the DSL text for the schema rather than the parsed schema in JSON types. Then we could inline it or link to it encoded into any codec that supports the data model. This would also allow the tools to more easily embed versioning information or other parser requirements.</p> <hr> <h4 id="_2019-05-02t05-41-35z-rvagg"><a href="#_2019-05-02t05-41-35z-rvagg" class="header-anchor">#</a> (2019-05-02T05:41:35Z) rvagg:</h4> <blockquote><p>I don’t see why we would not want to contain all the schema information in the schema instead of as metadata in the reference to the schema</p></blockquote> <p>Well, that's mainly because many schemas will have to be constructed of multiple, inter-dependent types, so a loader will have to know which type it's loading in the current block.</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>type FooType struct {
bar BarType
baz String
yoiks Link&lt;FooType&gt;
}

type BarType struct { String : Int }
</code></pre></div><p>We'd need a rule like: the first type in a schema describes the current block, the rest are dependents. Unfortunately that would mean you can't use different parts of a schema for different purposes. You couldn't have a block that's a <code>FooType</code> with a <code>_schema</code> that points to this schema as well as a <code>BarType</code> with a <code>_schema</code> that points to the same schema used for a different purpose. That was the kind of flexibility I was imagining. Forcing a special case of the first type would also discourage mammoth general-purpose schemas (is that a good or a bad thing?).</p> <blockquote><p>I’d also like to avoid describing the block boundaries and instead just state that the _schema property is the schema, and it may be a link or it could even be inline. In general, we should just avoid these distinctions and make sure our tools for reading things never assume a particular block structure and only a specific graph shape.</p></blockquote> <p>OK, I think I just had a <code>&lt;click&gt;</code> moment. You keep talking about wanting to blur the block boundaries, so you're mainly talking about the tools making the boundaries transparent so the way we talk about them above the blocks doesn't have to involve things like &quot;could be a CID or inline&quot; because that's implied.</p> <blockquote><p>I don’t see why we would embed the DSL text for the schema rather than the parsed schema in JSON types.</p></blockquote> <p>Fair. Although that means we have to make sure we're paying as much attention to the parsed form (maybe we can call that the AST) as the DLS syntax.

I dunno about &quot;should&quot;, though.  It smells to me a lot like nominative typing, and I tend to feel we get better migrateability over time by aiming more towards the vicinity of structural typing.  (Not that nominative typing isn't <em>great</em> in programming languages; but data description is a different ballgame...)</p> <p>(EDIT: the next section may have taken &quot;native type/butterfly&quot; slightly too literally; if you meant &quot;schema type&quot;, your text makes more sense to me now, and this next paragraph is still true but slightly off-topic.)</p> <p>The big issue with explicitly linked schemas in the data itself is that it <em>doesn't</em> generally give you a way to translate into native types.  Codegen (<strong>or</strong> our reflecty 'bind' stuff in go-ipld-prime) is something you get to do <em>once</em> at compile time.  (Okay, I'm wearing very not-javascript^Wlisp-tinted glasses here -- suppose we have languages where <code>eval</code> at runtime is generally not a thing.  😃)  So, folks wanting to have native types matching their schema will generally run codegen once <em>for one specific schema version</em>... and then need to figure out how to map data that's from any other schema version into that form.

I guess this isn't committed to any documentation yet, but I also had some comments about the longevity of one vs the other over in  https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/10#issuecomment-488585486 .</p> <hr> <blockquote><p>Forcing a special case of the first type would also discourage mammoth general-purpose schemas (is that a good or a bad thing?).</p></blockquote> <p>FWIW, I tend to imagine using a bunch of small schemas in many programs, yeah.</p> <p>I think this probably also works better and is easier to imagine scaling up ecosystemically when going with the the structural-typing instead of nominative-typing take.  One doesn't just get most of the same issues when composing things with the structural-typing point of view -- the schema versions just aren't there to have the potential to conflict.</p> <hr> <p>Lots of nodding about the general concept of registering logic for handling some <code>FancyCollection</code>.</p> <p>An interesting devil in the details is... should there be different treatment of the algorithm (e.g. &quot;HAMT&quot; -- it's one thing; that's easy enough to register) vs more parameters the algorithm might have (e.g. bucket width -- <em>an int</em>, thus countably infinite range, and not so clear how to register)?</p> <hr> <p>There's a brief mention of potential relationship to selectors in the first post, and... I'd say, yeah, nah, I wouldn't try to worry about this.</p> <p>We can use selectors in various forms of interaction with advanced data layouts, sure: either by using them <em>with</em> a schema that points out the advLayout, thus allowing a single path step to translate into the entire internal operation of the advLayout; or by using them with a schema that <em>doesn't</em> point out the advLayout, and points out all the internal types of the advLayout's guts instead, in which case it can get some fraction of the internal nodes, etc.  That toggle is kinda cool.</p> <p>But things like HAMT sharding instantly get into more ✨ logic ✨  than we'll probably ever be capable of expressing in selectors (short of going full wasm), so... IMO, we should lean into that freely, and ignore selectors entirely while developing advanced layouts.  If it so <em>happens</em> that there's an advanced layout which is amenable to certain kinds of selector traversal mapping onto things like &quot;the first half of this tree&quot;, that's great; if not, well, fine.</p> <hr> <h4 id="_2019-05-02t13-42-05z-warpfork"><a href="#_2019-05-02t13-42-05z-warpfork" class="header-anchor">#</a> (2019-05-02T13:42:05Z) warpfork:</h4> <p>I wrote up another issue with some broad thoughts about high level design rules I've had cooking in the back of my head for a while, particularly with an eye towards convergence properties in the hashes in all the stuff we generate, and that also gets into a bunch of this territory: https://github.com/ipld/specs/issues/119</p> <hr> <h4 id="_2019-05-02t16-31-05z-mikeal"><a href="#_2019-05-02t16-31-05z-mikeal" class="header-anchor">#</a> (2019-05-02T16:31:05Z) mikeal:</h4> <blockquote><p>Well, that's mainly because many schemas will have to be constructed of multiple, inter-dependent types, so a loader will have to know which type it's loading in the current block.</p></blockquote> <p>Ahhh, gotcha, ya I hadn’t realized yet that the schema definitions are quite literally just definitions and don’t present a clear definition that would be applied.

There are performance tradeoffs on either side of this, on one side you get better deduplication and caching and on the other side you get better loading time when there is no cache state if you inline everything.

When parsing data, try the newer schema first; if it's rejected, try the old one, and use the migration function as necessary.</p> <p>If you're using codegen based on the schema, note that you'll probably only need to use codegen for the most recent / most preferred version of the schema. (This is a good thing! We wouldn't want tons of generated code per version to start stacking up in our repos.) Parsing of data for other versions can be handled by ipldcbor.Node or other such implementations which are optimized for handling serial data; the migration function is a natural place to build the codegenerated native typed Nodes, and so each half of the process can easily use the Node implementation that is best suited.</p></blockquote> <p>I'll have to ponder this more, maybe that's <em>good enough</em> of an answer.</p> <hr> <p>Still up for discussion is how to link to a schema, is it enough to just link to a CID or do you need to provide metadata to say what the entry point to the schema is? Is it enough to have the first type in the schema represent the parent entry point? My proposal for a <code>_schema</code> property would be as in OP, either <code>&quot;_schema&quot;: { &quot;ref&quot;: CID, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;MyType&quot; }</code> or <code>&quot;_schema&quot;: { &quot;defs&quot;: {...}, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;MyType&quot; }</code>.

Maybe a map of strings to ... any?)</p> <hr> <p>Also the interaction between schema and the advanced layout logic, but it sounds like we all just have vague ideas about how that will work.

In go-ipld-prime we already have very &quot;generic&quot; <code>Node</code> interfaces which should be a reasonable meeting place to make this happen.  The library code for the advanced layout can stay then in the library, and we can choose to have multiple versions of it there.
